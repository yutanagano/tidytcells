    Ensures that a string value looks like a valid junction (CDR3) amino acid sequence.
    This function is a special variant of :py:func:`tidytcells.aa.standardize`.

    A valid junction sequence must:

    1. Be a valid amino acid sequence
    2. Begin with a cysteine (C)
    3. End with a phenylalanine (F) or a tryptophan (W)

    :param seq:
        String value representing a junction sequence.
    :type seq:
        str
    :param strict:
        If ``True``, any string that does not look like a junction sequence is rejected.
        If ``False``, any inputs that are valid amino acid sequences but do not start with C and end with F/W are not rejected and instead are corrected by having a C appended to the beginning and an F appended at the end.
        Defaults to ``False``.
    :type strict:
        bool
    :param on_fail:
        Behaviour when standardization fails.
        If set to ``"reject"``, returns ``None`` on failure.
        If set to ``"keep"``, returns the original input.
        Defaults to ``"reject"``.
    :type on_fail:
        str
    :param suppress_warnings:
        Disable warnings that are usually emitted when standardisation fails.
        Defaults to ``False``.
    :type suppress_warnings:
        bool

    :return:
        If possible, a standardized version of the input string is returned.
        If the input string cannot be standardized, the function follows the behaviour as set by ``on_fail``.

        Union[str, None]

    .. topic:: Example usage

        Strings that look like junction sequences will be accepted, and returned in capitalised form.

        >>> tt.junction.standardize("csadaff")
        'CSADAFF'

        Strings that are valid amino acid sequences but do not stard and end with the appropriate residues will have a C and an F appended to its beginning and end respectively.

        >>> tt.junction.standardize("sadaf")
        'CSADAFF'

        However, setting ``strict`` to ``True`` will cause these cases to be rejected.

        >>> result = tt.junction.standardize("sadaf", strict=True)
        UserWarning: Input sadaf was rejected as it is not a valid junction sequence.
        >>> print(result)
        None
