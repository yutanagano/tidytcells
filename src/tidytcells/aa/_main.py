    Ensures that a string value looks like a valid amino acid sequence.

        String value representing an amino acid sequence.
    :type seq:
        str
    :param on_fail:
        Behaviour when standardization fails.
        If set to ``"reject"``, returns ``None`` on failure.
        If set to ``"keep"``, returns the original input.
        Defaults to ``"reject"``.
    :type on_fail:
        str
    :param suppress_warnings:
        Disable warnings that are usually emitted when standardisation fails.
        Defaults to ``False``.

        Capitalised version of ``seq``, if seq is a valid amino acid sequence.

    .. topic:: Example usage

        Strings that look like amino acid sequences will be accepted, and returned in capitalised form.

        >>> tt.aa.standardize("sqllnakyl")
        'SQLLNAKYL'

        Any strings that contain characters that cannot be recognised as amino acids will be rejected, and the function will return ``None``.

        >>> result = tt.aa.standardize("sqll?akyl")
        UserWarning: Input sqll?akyl was rejected as it is not a valid amino acid sequence.
        >>> print(result)
        None
