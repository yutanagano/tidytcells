   :alt: Cartoon of a T cell receptor binding to a peptide MH complex (left), and a cartoon demonstrating how messy data can be cleaned using tidytcells (right).

   **a)** A diagram of a T cell receptor (TR) interacting with a peptide-Major Histocompatibility (MH) complex.
   The V, D and J minigenes comprising each TR chain are shown by color.
   The red dotted lines point out the junction sequences of both TR chains.
   **b)** An illustration of how :py:mod:`tidytcells` can help clean TR data.
   By using :py:mod:`tidytcells`, non-standard nomenclature in the "messy data" is corrected, and any invalid values are filtered out.

:py:mod:`tidytcells` is a lightweight python package that cleans and standardizes T cell receptor (TR) and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MH) data to be IMGT-compliant (`IMGT/GENE-DB <https://www.imgt.org/genedb/>`_, `IMGT Repertoire <https://www.imgt.org/IMGTrepertoire/>`_).
The main purpose of the package is to solve the problem of parsing and collating together non-standardized TR datasets.
It is often difficult to compile TR data from multiple sources because the formats/nomenclature of how each dataset encodes TR and MH gene names are slightly different, or even inconsistent within themselves.
:py:mod:`tidytcells` can ameliorate this issue by auto-correcting and auto-standardizing your data!
